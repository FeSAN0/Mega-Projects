    <h2>Seljuk City Of Konya</h2>
    <h5>In 1076, Konya became the capital of the Anatolian Seljuks.</h5>

    <p>
      After Konya became the capital of the Seljuk State, it marked a significant period in Turkish history. This change took place during the reign of Alp Arslan in the year 1077, moving the capital from the previous capital, Isfahan. The decision to relocate was based on political and strategic considerations.

The geographical location of Konya, positioned at the center of Central Anatolia and in the heart of the expanded borders of the Seljuk State, provided a strategic advantage. This decision aimed to administer the state more effectively and control internal disturbances in Anatolia.

The choice of Konya also allowed Seljuk rulers to be more directly involved in the political events occurring in Anatolia. In the process of conquering Anatolia, Konya was utilized as a strategic base to achieve the goal of maintaining political stability in the region.

The relocation of the Seljuk capital to Konya also transformed the city into a significant cultural and trade center. Konya contributed greatly to the development of Seljuk architecture and art, hosting important Islamic scholars like Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi. This period laid the foundation for Konya to maintain its historical importance and influence over time..</p>

    <p>The period of Mevlana Celâleddin-i Rûmî</p><br>
    <p>Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi's life begins in 1207 when he was born in the city of Balkh. His father, Bahaeddin Veled, a dervish devoted to learning and teaching, migrated with his family to Anatolia, settling in Konya. There, Mevlana engaged in various sciences, receiving education in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy.

A pivotal moment in his life occurred when Mevlana encountered Shams Tabrizi, his mentor. Shams Tabrizi's teachings profoundly shook Mevlana's conventional thought, leading him through a deep internal transformation. His relationship with Shams, marked by themes of love and spiritual unity, inspired many of his poems.

Mevlana's teachings center around the idea that individuals can reach God through love. His masterpiece, the "Mathnawi," extensively explores this concept and delves into mystical teachings. His poems cover a wide range of themes, including humanity, love, tolerance, and unity, earning him a broad fan base.

Although Mevlana passed away in 1273, his teachings and the Mevlevi Order he founded had a significant impact. The order, known for its whirling dervishes and sema ceremonies, gained recognition. Mevlana's mausoleum in Konya stands as a significant spiritual center, drawing the interest of visitors. His works and thoughts continue to be cherished and widely read by many to this day.</p>
